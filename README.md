# Git-pass

### A privacy-focused password manager

- Git-pass uses the master password obtained from the user to encryt user's passwords.
- These encrypted passwords are stored in a github repository provided by the user, giving complete access of user's data to only themselves.
- These repositories can be deleted by the user at anytime. 
- Git-pass does not store any passwords on its backend server.
